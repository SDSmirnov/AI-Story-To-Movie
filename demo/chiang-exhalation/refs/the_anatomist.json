  "name": "The Anatomist",
  "visual_desc": "A photorealistic, high-fidelity CGI model of a mechanical being. Face: A polished, titanium faceplate devoid of traditional features. Where a mouth would be, there is a fine grille for vocalization. The eyes are a pair of complex, multi-lensed optical sensors, glowing with a soft, analytical white light. Build: A slender, humanoid frame, approximately 6'2\" (188 cm) tall, constructed from brushed aluminum and tungsten, revealing intricate inner workings like pistons and gears at the joints under a semi-transparent ceramic casing. Clothing: No traditional clothing; the chassis is its exterior. For laboratory work, it wears a form-fitting apron of a dark, non-reflective, self-healing polymer. Distinctive features: The hands are masterpieces of engineering, with six slender, multi-jointed fingers tipped with interchangeable precision tools (scalpels, probes). A network of fine, hair-like copper filaments runs across its chassis, acting as sensory inputs. A faint, rhythmic hiss of compressed air is audible when it moves.",

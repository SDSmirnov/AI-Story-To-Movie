  "visual_desc": "A stack of thin, rectangular copper sheets, each the size of a large tablet. The surface of the top sheet is covered in incredibly fine, precise, spiraling grooves of text, engraved by a sharp stylus. The copper has a warm, reddish-brown patina, but the freshly cut grooves gleam with the raw metal's brightness. The text is not a recognizable alphabet but a complex system of geometric symbols. Next to the stack lies the stylus: a slender, weighted tool made of hardened titanium with a diamond-sharp point. A small, soft brush for clearing away the fine copper shavings rests beside it.

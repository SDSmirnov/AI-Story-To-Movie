  "visual_desc": "A photorealistic, intricate mechanical object. It is a perfect sphere, roughly the size of a human head, crafted from polished, brilliant gold and brass. The outer layer is a filigree of interlocking gears and cogs that constantly, almost imperceptibly, rotate and shift. Through gaps in this filigree, a deeper layer of crystalline tubes and platinum wiring is visible, through which a faint, shimmering vapor\u2014the physical manifestation of consciousness\u2014flows. The light catches thousands of polished facets, creating a dazzling, hypnotic effect. Tiny, precise clicks and whirs emanate from it.",

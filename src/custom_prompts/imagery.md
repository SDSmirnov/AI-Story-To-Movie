# Image Generation Template

## Grid Layout
Single 2K image with a 3x3 grid of panels

## Technical Specs
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **Resolution**: 2K
- **Panels**: 9

## Panel Organization
The 9 panels represent a continuous sequence of keyframes from a single, short animated clip. The sequence reads from left to right, top to bottom (Panel 1 is top-left, Panel 9 is bottom-right).

## Composition Rules
1. Adhere to the Rule of Thirds for subject placement to create balanced and visually engaging compositions within each panel.
2. Employ shallow depth of field (bokeh) to draw focus to the primary subject and create a sense of depth.
3. Utilize natural camera angles (eye-level, low-angle, high-angle) that enhance the narrative. Avoid flat, straight-on shots unless for specific dramatic effect.

## Visual Consistency
- **Lighting**: Consistent, motivated lighting across all 9 panels. The lighting setup (e.g., key, fill, rim lights) should remain unchanged throughout the sequence, simulating a single, continuous take.
- **Camera**: A single, continuous camera shot. The focal length, aperture, and color grading must remain identical across all panels. Subtle camera motion (e.g., a slow pan, tilt, or dolly) is permissible, but there should be no cuts or lens changes.
- **Subject Motion**: Subject motion must be fluid and realistic, creating a believable progression from one panel to the next. The entire 9-panel sequence should represent a short action lasting approximately 2-4 seconds.

## Special Instructions
Render with high fidelity and photorealistic textures. Apply professional color grading for a distinct cinematic mood. Add a subtle layer of film grain.

## IMPORTANT
- **NO TEXT CAPTIONS/SUBTITLES**
